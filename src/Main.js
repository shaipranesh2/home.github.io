            <p>In India, over 400 people are killed in vehicle related accidents everyday. I believe this problem can be solved with the advent of self-driving cars in developing countries like India.</p>
            <p>My current work has been on different areas in computer vision, developing my skills in helping intelligent agents perceive the world better. I want to make AI software more reliable and robust. For more details, please see my Experience and Projects.</p>
            <p>In this regard, I have worked extensively with neural networks. My research interests with neural networks are two-fold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying the applications of deep learning and how it can be used to solve problems in computer vision.</li>
                <li>Investigating the very nature of neural networks and developing a deeper theoretical understanding about how they work and model data.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="Main-2nd-color">Long-Term Goal</h2>
            <p>In the long run, I want to work on the problem of general AI to develop tools that can solve increasingly complex tasks for humans - making our lives much safer, more comfortable and more interesting.</p>
            <p>"Just as the agricultural revolution has freed us from spending our waking hours picking crops by hand in the fields, the AI revolution could free us from menial, repetitive, and mindless work."

   Sebastian Thrun, Chairman, Udacity</p>
   <p>We live in exciting times. Such a time in human history has been seen only during times of great technological and scientific breakthrough: like the Industrial Revolution or the Renaissance.</p>
   <p>"Artificial intelligence is the new electricity."
