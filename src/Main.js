            <p>Neural Networks can act as function approximators and has the power to better predict and exploit data in a manner never seen before!</p>
            <p>My current work has been on different areas developing my skills in helping intelligent agents perceive the world better. I want to make AI software more reliable, robust and open-source to all. For more details, please see my Experience and Projects.</p>
            <p>In this regard, I have worked extensively with neural networks. My research interests with neural networks are two-fold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying the applications of deep learning and how it can be used to solve problems in Sciences.</li>
                <li>Investigating deeplearning methods for better usage multi-modal data (Speech, Vision, Gesture data, etc.).</li>
                
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 className="Main-2nd-color">Long-Term Goal</h2>
            <p>In the long run, I want to work on the problem of Artificial General Intelligence(AGI), and research on the new methods to acheive it to make our lives simpler and break out from the everyday mundane activities!! </p>
